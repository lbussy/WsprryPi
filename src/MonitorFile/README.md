# MonitorFile

MonitorFile is a lightweight C++20 component for monitoring file changes by
polling filesystem metadata. Its public API remains in `src/monitorfile.hpp`,
with the implementation in `src/monitorfile.cpp`.

## Building and testing

From the WsprryPi checkout:

```sh
cd src/MonitorFile/src
make release
make test
```

The fixed standalone outputs are `build/bin/monitorfile` and
`build/bin/monitorfile_test`. The test creates its observed file under the
system temporary directory, waits for a bounded period, and removes the
temporary directory before exiting. It does not use GPIO, RF, devices,
services, installation, or elevated privileges.

To use the component in C++, include `monitorfile.hpp`, compile
`monitorfile.cpp`, and link with the platform threading support required by the
application. The class can invoke a callback after a monitored file change has
stabilized. `setPriority()` is optional and can require additional privileges
for real-time scheduling policies; the ordinary test does not call it.

## Retained component boundary

This directory is ordinary tracked content in the WsprryPi monorepo, not a Git
submodule. Keep the README, Makefile, test entry point, header, and implementation
together so the component remains independently understandable and buildable.

For a future standalone extraction, copy `src/MonitorFile`, initialize a new
repository, and add an appropriate license file. The imported source revision
and original historical repository are recorded in
`docs/components/provenance.md`. No synchronization with that historical remote
is implied.

## License

While part of WsprryPi, this component is covered by the repository-root
`LICENSE.md` (MIT).
