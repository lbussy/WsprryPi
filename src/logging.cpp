/**
 * @brief Initializes the logger with the appropriate log level.
 *
 * This function sets the log level based on the current debug state. If the
 * build is compiled with the DEBUG_BUILD macro, the log level is set to DEBUG.
 * Otherwise, it defaults to INFO.
 *
 * @note Ensure that the `get_debug_state()` function correctly reflects the
 *       build configuration for accurate log level assignment.
 *
 * @example
 * initialize_logger();
 * // Sets llog to DEBUG or INFO depending on the build mode.
