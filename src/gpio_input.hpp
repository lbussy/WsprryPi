/**
 * @class GPIOInput
 * @brief Monitors a GPIO pin using libgpiod with thread-based event handling.
 *
 * This class allows for edge-triggered monitoring of a GPIO pin using the
 * libgpiod C++ API. It supports edge detection (rising or falling), optional
 * internal pull-up or pull-down configuration, CPU priority control, debounce
 * management, and thread-safe lifecycle operations.
 *
 * Designed for use on the Raspberry Pi platform with BCM GPIO numbering, the
 * class is thread-based and suitable for global instantiation.
 *
 * Dependencies: libgpiod >= 1.6.
 *
 * Thread-safe: Yes.
 * Reentrant: No.
