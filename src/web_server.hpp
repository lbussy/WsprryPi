/**
 * @class WebServer
 * @brief A simple web server that runs in a separate thread with CORS support.
 *
 * @details
 * The WebServer class creates an HTTP server that listens on a user-specified port.
 * It will not start until the start() method is called with a valid port number (1024 to 65535).
 * The server handles:
 *  - GET requests by sending a JSON response.
 *  - PUT and PATCH requests by parsing the request body as JSON, printing it for debugging,
 *    and returning a text response.
 *  - OPTIONS requests to support CORS preflight, setting the proper headers.
 *
 * The server runs in its own thread and can be stopped cleanly by calling stop(), which uses
 * condition variables for synchronization.
