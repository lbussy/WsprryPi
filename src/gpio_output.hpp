/**
 * @class GPIOOutput
 * @brief Simple GPIO output controller using libgpiod.
 *
 * This class configures a specified GPIO pin as an output. The pin can be
 * configured as active high (default) or as an active low sink. Methods are provided
 * to enable (configure) the pin, disable (release) it, and toggle its output state.
 *
 * Example:
 * @code
 * GPIOOutput gpio;
 * gpio.enableGPIOPin(17, true); // enable pin 17 as active high output
 * gpio.toggleGPIO(true);         // set pin high (active)
 * gpio.toggleGPIO(false);        // set pin low (inactive)
 * gpio.stop_gpio_pin();        // release the pin
 * @endcode
