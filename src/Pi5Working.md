To adapt this code for the Raspberry Pi 5, adjustments are mainly necessary to ensure compatibility with the new memory mapping and possibly updated peripheral base addresses. For Raspberry Pi 5 (which has a BCM2712 SoC and a new RP1 I/O controller), the base addresses for peripherals like GPIO, PWM, and DMA may differ.

Here's a summary of what may need changing:
1. Peripheral Base Addresses

    The base addresses for peripherals in the code (e.g., `GPIO_BUS_BASE`, `DMA_BUS_BASE`, `PWM_BUS_BASE`) are currently set based on earlier Pi models. For Raspberry Pi 5, these might be different. Confirm these addresses in the Raspberry Pi 5 datasheet or system documentation, then replace the constants as needed:

    ``` cpp
    #define GPIO_BUS_BASE (0x7E200000) // Adjust for RPi 5 if different
    #define CM_GP0CTL_BUS (0x7e101070) // Adjust for RPi 5 if different
    #define CM_GP0DIV_BUS (0x7e101074) // Adjust for RPi 5 if different
    #define DMA_BUS_BASE (0x7E007000)  // Adjust for RPi 5 if different
    #define PWM_BUS_BASE (0x7e20C000)  /* PWM controller, Adjust for RPi 5 if different */
    ```

2. `getPLLD` Function

    For Raspberry Pi 5, ensure it uses the appropriate PLLD frequency:

    ``` cpp
    case 4: // RPi5
        config.mem_flag = 0x04;
        config.f_plld_clk = (1000000000.0); // Replace with actual RPi 5 PLLD frequency if different
        break;
    ```

3. GPIO Base Mapping in `setupGPIO`

    You might need to adjust the base address used in setupGPIO and setup_peri_base_virt if the Raspberry Pi 5 GPIO layout differs.

    ``` cpp
    unsigned gpio_base = gpioBase() + 0x200000; // Adjust for RPi 5 if needed
    ```

4. Accessing the RP1 I/O Controller

    The Raspberry Pi 5 RP1 handles I/O in a more advanced way. Check if the DMA, PWM, and other peripheral mappings require initialization via RP1 or if other setup steps are needed.
    Testing and Verification

    Since hardware configurations are crucial for this code, test on an actual Raspberry Pi 5 to verify compatibility and stability after making these adjustments.

    This is a general approach based on typical differences with new Raspberry Pi models. Adjustments will be finalized based on actual addresses and configurations for the Raspberry Pi 5.
