# Wsprry Pi
*A QRP WSPR transmitter leveraging a Raspberry Pi*

Pronounced: (Whispery Pi)

This work likely traces its origins to an idea Oliver Mattos and Oskar Weigl presented at the PiFM project. While the website is no longer online, the Wayback Machine has [the last known good version]( http://web.archive.org/web/20131016184311/http://www.icrobotics.co.uk/wiki/index.php/Turning_the_Raspberry_Pi_Into_an_FM_Transmitter).

The original PiFM code is still hosted by the icrobotics.co.uk website. However, I suspect the domain has fallen into disrepair and may be unsafe, and no direct links are provided here. You may be able to use the link above to see the site, and should the code disappear, I have [saved it here](./historical/pifm.tar.gz).

This project is a fork of threeme3/WsprryPi, which was licensed under the GNU General Public License v3 (GPLv3). The original project is no longer maintained, and this fork aims to continue its development.

My work was inspired by a conversation with Bruce Raymond of TAPR, this fork has diverged substantially from its origins and operates as an independent
project.
