## License

Versions 2.x+ of this project are distributed the [MIT License](LICENSE.MIT.md).

## Origins

This idea likely traces its origins to an idea Oliver Mattos and Oskar Weigl presented at the PiFM project. While the website is no longer online, the Wayback Machine has [the last known good version]( http://web.archive.org/web/20131016184311/http://www.icrobotics.co.uk/wiki/index.php/Turning_the_Raspberry_Pi_Into_an_FM_Transmitter).

The original PiFM code is still hosted by the icrobotics.co.uk website. However, I suspect the domain has fallen into disrepair and may be unsafe, and no direct links are provided here. You can use the link above to see the site; should the code disappear, I have [saved it here](./historical/pifm.tar.gz).

After a conversation with Bruce Raymond of TAPR; I forked @threeme3's repo and provided some rudimentary installation capabilities and associated orchestration.  Version's 1.x of this project were a fork of threeme3/WsprryPi, licensed under the GNU General Public License v3 (GPLv3). The original project is no longer maintained.

In late 2024, George [K9TRV] of TAPR reached out to me about some questions related to using WsprryPi on the Pi 5.  While I have not yet made that jump, the conversation spurred me to discard the original code in favor of a more modern, extensible, and maintainable base.

Version 2.x+ is re-written from scratch, is no longer a derivative work, and is released under the MIT license.

## Development and testing

Developers can exercise WsprryPi's application planning, scheduling,
cancellation, status, failure, and cleanup paths on an ordinary Debian machine
without GPIO, MMIO, mailbox, DMA, I2C, transmitter device nodes, or RF hardware.
See the [hardware-free simulated backend guide](docs/simulated-backend.md) for
building, explicit selection, deterministic virtual-time traces, bounded
real-time tests, fault injection, repeated execution, Debian CI, and the limits
of simulation evidence.

The [WTP-Client component](src/WTP-Client/README.md) provides the portable WTP/1
wire and session foundation for Phase 10 Pico integration. It has a standalone hardware-free
test suite; application/backend integration remains planned.

For containerized ARMv6 and AArch64 builds targeting Raspberry Pi OS Bookworm
and Trixie, including 32-bit Pi 1/A+ and Pi Zero support, see the
[container build guide](docs/container-builds.md). For installing those artifacts,
see the [precompiled installer contract](docs/precompiled-installation.md).

RP1 GPCLK support is compiled into the application as a consumer of the
independently maintained `/dev/rp1-gpclk` provider. On Pi 5-family systems the
installer can resolve and validate an eligible published provider release; it
also supports fail-closed exact-source development selection. See the
[RP1-GPCLK-DKMS installation contract](docs/rp1-gpclk-dkms-installation.md).
On uninstall, WsprryPi removes only an unchanged provider that its secure
ownership record proves WsprryPi installed; all pre-existing, legacy-recorded,
ambiguous, or drifted providers are preserved. Operators can set
`REMOVE_RP1_GPCLK_DKMS=false` to retain even a proven owned provider. WsprryPi
establishes only route-neutral runtime administration during installation. It
waits for a later explicit GPIO4/GPIO20 operator choice before executing a
digest-reviewed route plan, and it never enables output as part of installation
or route selection. Runtime checks establish application compatibility only; they do
not qualify installation, GPIO behavior, timing, frequency accuracy, spectral
performance, or RF output.
