# Wsprry Pi
*A QRP WSPR transmitter leveraging a Raspberry Pi*

Pronounced: (Whispery Pi)

[![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/wsprry-pi/badge/?version=latest)](https://wsprry-pi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest)

This project likely traces its origins to an idea Oliver Mattos and Oskar Weigl presented at the PiFM project. While the website is no longer online, the Wayback Machine has [the last known good version]( http://web.archive.org/web/20131016184311/http://www.icrobotics.co.uk/wiki/index.php/Turning_the_Raspberry_Pi_Into_an_FM_Transmitter).

The original PiFM code is still hosted by the icrobotics.co.uk website. However, I suspect the domain has fallen into disrepair and may be unsafe, and no direct links are provided here. You can safely use the link above to see the site, and should the code disappear, I have [saved it here](./historical/pifm.tar.gz).

This WsprryPi project was originally forked from threeme3/WsprryPi (no longer available). It has been significantly updated, improved, and documented for ease of use.   Inspired by a conversation with Bruce Raymond of [TAPR](https://tapr.org/), this fork has diverged substantially from its origins and operates as an independent project.

Please see [the documentation](https://wsprry-pi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for background, installation, and use.
