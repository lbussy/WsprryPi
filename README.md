## Origins

This idea likely traces its origins to an idea Oliver Mattos and Oskar Weigl presented at the PiFM project. While the website is no longer online, the Wayback Machine has [the last known good version]( http://web.archive.org/web/20131016184311/http://www.icrobotics.co.uk/wiki/index.php/Turning_the_Raspberry_Pi_Into_an_FM_Transmitter).

The original PiFM code is still hosted by the icrobotics.co.uk website. However, I suspect the domain has fallen into disrepair and may be unsafe, and no direct links are provided here. You can use the link above to see the site; should the code disappear, I have [saved it here](./historical/pifm.tar.gz).

After a conversation with Bruce Raymond of TAPR; I forked @threeme3's repo and provided some rudimentary installation capabilities and associated orchestration.  Version's 1.x of this project were a fork of threeme3/WsprryPi, licensed under the GNU General Public License v3 (GPLv3). The original project is no longer maintained.

In late 2024, George [K9TRV] of TAPR reached out to me about some questions related to using WsprryPi on the Pi 5.  While I have not yet made that jump, the conversation spurred me to discard the original code in favor of a more modern, extensible, and maintainable base.

Version 2.x+ is re-written from scratch, is no longer a derivative work, and is released under the MIT license.
