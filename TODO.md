# To Do's

- Update documentation for 12m info
- Document new org
- Figure out how to filter out DEBUG from WsprTransmitter
- "I am only testing the current stable and oldstable versions: Bookworm and Bullseye."
- "All current development has been done with g++ version 10.2.1 20210110 (Raspbian 10.2.1-6+rpi1)."
