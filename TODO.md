## Documentation

- [ ] Documentation needs updates from/related to changes to command line parsing (including INI vs option precedence)
- [ ] Note in docs that they may see: `2025-02-20 23:10:00 UTC [INFO ] Transmission started.` ... this is a floating point rounding issue.
- [ ] DMA notes at: `https://github.com/fandahao17/Raspberry-Pi-DMA-Tutorial`

## Shit to Remember

- [ ] No need to disable_sound() on Pi 5 and up (install and uninstall)
