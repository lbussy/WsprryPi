    ... this is a floating point rounding issue.
- [ ] Stop after X iterations <- This functionality not yet implemented
- [ ] Loop through frequencies at each iteration
- [ ] Add configurable transmission pin to transmission logic: ini.get_int_value("Common", "Transmit Pin"));
- [ ] Figure out how to add in DMA stuff for transmission
- [ ] Also change priority for transmissions
