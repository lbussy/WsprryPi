# TODO

- [ ] Need to allow -v and such without sudo check
- [ ] Invalid PPM value, defaulting to use NTP <-- shown when using NTP
- [ ] After initial startup, a second "WSPR packet payload:" pops up with a duplicate frequency
- [ ] Integrate WSPR-Transmitter
- [ ] Documentation needs updates from/related to changes to command line parsing (including INI vs option precedence)
- [ ] Note in docs that they may see: `2025-02-20 23:10:00 UTC [INFO ] Transmission started.` ... this is a floating point rounding issue.
- [ ] DMA notes at: `https://github.com/fandahao17/Raspberry-Pi-DMA-Tutorial`
- [ ] Review if we do or can do WSPR-15
- [ ] Create new REST-based web page
