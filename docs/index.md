# Wsprry Pi

This project is for amateur (ham) radio enthusiasts who want to experiment with signal propagation using WSPR using an inexpensive single-board computer (Raspberry Pi). This implementation of WSPR, called "wsprrypi" here to differentiate the application from the protocol, has been available for quite some time as an application that utilizes the specific capabilities of the Raspberry Pi.

Wsprry Pi (whispery pie) was developed to enable ham enthusiasts to enter this realm with relatively low-cost equipment.
