# Authenticated WTP network integration

Phase 11.1 adds the parent-owned OpenSSL `TlsStream` behind the existing portable
WTP-Client `ByteStream`. The same application, scheduler, backend, Session,
complete-job conversion, cancellation and recovery paths serve USB and network.
The portable component and its provenance/fixtures are unchanged. There is no
transport fallback or browser-owned scheduler.

## Configuration and migration

Legacy `[WTP]` sections without `Transport` mean `usb`. Their existing endpoint,
serial, VID/PID and device-ID requirements are unchanged. Network fields and USB
fields persist while inactive. The existing uncertainty and frequency-adjustment
consent apply to both transports. A complete network section looks like:

```ini
[Operation]
Transmit Backend = wtp
Transmit = false

[WTP]
Transport = network
Hostname = wsprrypico-aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa.local
TCP Port = 18443
TLS Server Identity =
TLS CA File = /etc/wsprrypi/pico/ca.crt
TLS Client Certificate = /etc/wsprrypi/pico/client.crt
TLS Client Key = /etc/wsprrypi/pico/client.key
Device ID = aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
Start Uncertainty ns = 1000000
Allow Frequency Adjustment = false
```

Replace the example identity, port and files with administrator-provisioned
values. There is no assumed production port. Other required application settings
and safety policy still apply; this fragment is not a complete runnable station
configuration. Keep the existing enabled-transmission/boot settings disabled
while selecting and inspecting an endpoint. GPIO peripherals and fades remain
incompatible with WTP. The CLI remains `--backend wtp --ini-file <file>`.

`Hostname` is the connection address. Blank `TLS Server Identity` verifies that
configured hostname or literal IP. For a direct-IP connection, an explicit DNS
identity can instead authenticate a certificate for that name. IP identities
require a certificate IP SAN. DNS names use ASCII labels (IDNs must be provided
as A-labels); URL schemes, ports in names, trailing dots, wildcard input and IPv6
zone identifiers are rejected. Configure the TCP port separately.

DHCP plus mDNS is the intended normal deployment; address reservations are not
required. Every fresh connection resolves again through the host's system
`getaddrinfo` service. On Linux, the host administrator must provide a working
NSS resolver for `.local` multicast DNS, commonly Avahi plus `libnss-mdns` and an
appropriate `hosts` policy. WsprryPi does not install those services, alter
`/etc/hosts`, edit resolver configuration, use reverse DNS as identity, or change
system trust stores. A host lacking `.local` resolution reports connection
failure. Real joint name-resolution acceptance belongs to 11.3.

## Credentials and TLS policy

Use maintained OS OpenSSL 3 development/runtime packages (`libssl-dev` and
`pkg-config` on Debian). The parent now discovers `openssl`, linking both libssl
and libcrypto; existing installer dependencies already include libssl-dev.
The build rejects older headers. TLS 1.3, server-chain and expected-name/IP
verification, a matching client certificate/key and exact ALPN `wtp/1` are
mandatory. Idle management uses the same credentials with ALPN `http/1.1`.
There is no plaintext mode, trust-on-first-use, verification bypass, session
resumption cache or early-data submission.

Credential references are absolute local paths, not uploaded PEM or browser
storage. Files must be readable regular files, at most 256 KiB each, with no
final symlink or group/other write permission. Private keys must be owned by the
application user or root, with no group/other permission (typically 0600).
Administrator-managed parent directories must also remain protected. Encrypted
keys requiring an interactive passphrase are rejected without prompting.
Client validity and certificate/key consistency are checked before selection.
The configured CA bundle, not the machine-wide trust store, supplies trust.

The runtime holds an immutable validated credential snapshot and content
fingerprint. An explicit configuration apply/reload compares contents even when
paths are unchanged. Replacement is permitted only when the existing runtime
can be safely replaced. Reconnect and management detect changed/unusable files
and refuse to substitute a different authenticated principal under the old
session. To rotate, first finish/reconcile ownership with the original credential
material, then replace files and explicitly reload while unowned and inactive.
Restoring the original contents permits recovery; changing a pathname alone is
not the rotation detector. Revoking/removing the old credentials during unresolved
work can therefore prevent recovery. No private-key contents or fingerprints are
published in status, logs or configuration responses; protected configuration
responses expose only the administrator's file references.

## Bounds and output authority

System resolution runs outside the WTP worker with one process-wide outstanding
lookup. The caller stops waiting after 3 seconds or cancellation; an unresponsive
platform NSS call cannot be forcibly interrupted and may occupy that one slot
until it returns. Further opens fail closed while it remains outstanding. This
bounds worker shutdown and resource growth without claiming NSS itself is killed.
TCP connection attempts share a 3-second budget and at most eight resolved
addresses; TLS handshake has 10 seconds. The TLS stream owns at most 4096 queued
plaintext bytes with an 8-second write deadline. Session supplies bounded read/
transaction progress budgets. HTTPS has a 20-second total exchange deadline.
Idle management also performs WTP inspection before and after the exchange, so
its browser wait budget is longer. No network call belongs to per-event RF timing.

Accepted plaintext is reported as Progress when copied into the owned queue.
The exact queue buffer remains stable across OpenSSL WANT retries. Later failure
is ambiguous accepted output; it never becomes a claim that zero bytes were sent.
Transport closure, cancellation, TLS failure, reboot or lost acknowledgement
cannot establish inactive output. HELLO device/boot checks and authoritative
STATUS remain mandatory, with the same-session recovery and historical failure
rules described in [status and recovery](wtp-status-recovery.md).

`WSPRRYPI_DISABLE_HARDWARE_ACCESS=1` rejects production network access before
resolution or socket creation. The C++ `LoopbackTest` seam permits only numeric
loopback results; no CLI, INI, browser or environment option enables that seam.

## Browser and present Pico limits

The development visibility boolean still controls the existing Transmitter panel.
**Use Pico** selects the backend; **Connection** selects USB or Network (TLS).
Fields, validation failures and status polling preserve drafts. Network status
separates the configured endpoint, resolved address, last authenticated identity,
connection state/diagnostic and observation age. These are historical software
observations; failed polling explicitly presents output as unknown.

See [shared browser API](wtp-browser-api.md) for resources, revisions and delegated
job cancellation. Remote standalone settings are distinct from WsprryPi settings.
Load/save actions are explicit and available only while the selected host runtime
is ready, idle, unowned and resolved; the backend rechecks authority. Polling does
not open an HTTP connection, release ownership, recover or mutate configuration.
Schedule-only saving preserves unrelated drafts. Saved standalone configuration
requires a Pico restart; this interface does not request one. Disabling Pico
Wi-Fi can disconnect control; restoring network access then requires its supported
Console/restart workflow.

The tested unmodified Pico revision is
`0fd8191c5218d3b5f2da9122a2ae55bf728ae3f2`. It defaults network control off,
services one TLS session with one waiting TCP connection, and refuses fresh
handshakes during physical armed/running jobs. Idle management acquires the same
host operation lock, obtains fresh unowned/inactive WTP status, disconnects the
idle stream without RELEASE, performs one HTTP exchange, then re-inspects WTP.
It never releases a job merely to obtain HTTP status.

That Pico revision requires numeric HTTP Host/Origin authority and its certificate
helper requires an IP address. The host uses the resolved numeric HTTP authority
while still authenticating the separately configured TLS identity. Present-server
interop uses loopback IP SAN; separate TLS fixtures test hostname identities.
Pico mDNS, hostname certificate provisioning and concurrent physical-job browser
servicing are not implemented by this host work.

## Hardware-free validation

From `src`, with clean read-only source checkouts at the documented pins:

```sh
make wtp-api-test SUDO=
make wtp-tls-test SUDO=
make wtp-network-runtime-test BACKENDS=simulated ANCILLARY_GPIO=0 SUDO=
make wtp-network-interop-test SUDO= \
  PICO_SOURCE=/path/to/WsprryPico \
  MBEDTLS_SOURCE=/path/to/pico-sdk/lib/mbedtls
node ../WsprryPi-UI/tests/wtp_network_ui_integration_test.js
```

Mbed TLS pin: `0bebf8b8c7f07abe3571ded48a11aa907a1ffb20`, including its SDK
submodules. CMake verifies both clean tracked source trees and pins; no download
or sibling modification occurs. Ephemeral keys, generated credential headers,
server/client binaries and screenshots stay in ignored `src/build/wtp-network`.
The WsprryPi-owned server harness supplies a valid 32-hex device identity and
inhibited software engine. Its POSIX adapter handles fatal socket errors with
lwIP's free-before-error-callback contract; Pico server/core source is unmodified.

Use a different `WTP_NETWORK_BUILD_DIR` for sanitizer flags; pass matching
`CMAKE_C_FLAGS`/`CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS` to that CMake directory and
`WTP_NETWORK_CXXFLAGS`/`WTP_NETWORK_LDFLAGS` to Make. The CI loopback job includes
TLS, actual Pico interop and rendered browser tests. Local execution is not a CI
run. See the [acceptance record](development/phase11-1-review.md) for exact results.

11.2 concurrent physical-job service, 11.3 joint DHCP/mDNS/certificates, 11.4
inhibited physical acceptance, 11.5 target resources/contention, 11.6 conducted RF
and 11.7 final cross-repository closure remain separate. This is software evidence,
not physical USB, GPIO, timing, RF, installation or service qualification.
