# Wsprry Pi Operations

All normal control operations revolve around the Wsprry Pi's configuration file. This file is manipulated by a web UI and accessed by the `wspr` executable. If wspr is running, a change to this file will take effect at the next transmission period, which is the top of an even minute for normal WSPR, or at the top of the quarter hour for -15 operations. If wspr is not actively transmitting and you change the transmit selection, the system will apply the changes at the next proper WSPR window.

## Web Interface

The web interface is designed to be a simple-to-use yet comprehensive interface to the wspr program.

![Web Interface Screenshot](web_interface.png)

Since the wspr application runs as a system daemon, the web page saves the configuration and is picked up immediately by the wspr application.

Configuration items:

- Control
  - Enable Transmission
    - Off: While the transmission is disabled, the wspr program will still run and monitor the configuration for changes.
    - On: The wspr program will transmit based on the saved configuration.
  - Enable LED: The TAPR Pi Hat includes a red LED attached to Pin 12 (GPIO18, BCM18). When enabled, this LED will light during transmission.
- Operator Information
  - Call Sign: This should be your registered callsign. Please do not make things up or use another person's callsign. It is illegal and immoral, and you will eventually annoy someone enough for them to find and report you.
  - Grid Square: The Maidenhead Locator System coordinates, also called QTH locators, grid locators, or grid squares. Use the first four digits only; two letters followed by two numbers.
- Station Information
  - Transmit Power: Transmit power in dBm. This entry is informational for the WSPR packet and does not affect the energy used to transmit the message. Typically, this value is 10, representing the Raspberry Pi's signal power capability. If you are using the TAPR hat, it includes an amplifier raising this dBm level to 20.
  - Frequency: Frequencies can be specified as an absolute TX carrier frequency (e.g., 14097100 for 20-meter WSPR) or using one of the strings in the table below. If you use a string, the transmission will happen in the middle of the WSPR region of the selected band. You may use multiple frequencies separated by spaces; wspr will iterate through them in order. A 0 as a frequency is used in a frequency list to establish a transmission window gap. The web page will validate the entries and attempt to disallow an improper entry.
    - Random Offset: This switch will apply a random offset of +-8Hz for standard operations or 80Hz for -15 operations.
- Advanced Information
  - Self Calibration: This is an exclusive setting with PPM Offset below. If enabled (default,) wspr will use NTP to self-calibrate the transmission frequency.
  - PPM Offset: This is an exclusive setting with Self Calibration above. If Self Calibration is disabled, you may manually enter a PPM offset to the selected frequency.
- Transmit Power: This slider will set the transmit power to one of eight levels. This feature is for people running on experimental frequencies which need to limit transmission power. The default is 16mA / 10.6dBm. Note that this power level is before any amplification (such as provided by the TAPR board.)  The settings are:

  0. 2mA / -3.4dBm
  1. 4mA / 2.1dBm
  2. 6mA / 4.9dBm
  3. 8mA / 6.6dBm
  4. 10mA / 8.2dBm
  5. 12mA / 9.2dBm
  6. 14mA / 10.0dBm
  7. 16mA / 10.6dBm

| Frequency Designator | Frequency in Hz |
| --- | --- |
| LF | 137500 |
| LF-15\* | 137612.5 |
| MF | 475700 |
| MF-15 | 475812.5 |
| 160m | 1838100 |
| 160m-15\* | 1838212.5 |
| 80m | 3570100 |
| 60m | 5288700 |
| 40m | 7040100 |
| 30m | 10140200 |
| 20m | 14097100 |
| 17m | 18106100 |
| 15m | 21096100 |
| 12m | 24926100 |
| 10m | 28126100 |
| 6m | 50294500 |
| 4m | 70092500 |
| 2m | 144490500 |

\*The `-15` suffix indicates the WSPR-15 region of the band.

  - Random Offset: Add a random frequency offset to each transmission:
    - +/- 80 Hz for WSPR
    - +/- 8 Hz for WSPR-15
- Advanced Information: These two items are exclusive. If Self-Calibration is enabled, the system will ignore any PPM Offset.
  - Self-Calibration: Uses an NTP check before every transmission to obtain the PPM error of the Raspberry Pi's crystal.
  - PPM Offset: An advanced setting to allow manual configuration of the Raspberry Pi's crystal offset.
- Save: Applies the currently displayed configuration. If any fields fail the basic checks, the field will be red and not allow saving. The changes may take time to change what wspr is doing; if wspr is actively transmitting, wspr will use the configuration change after the current transmission window ends.
- Reset: Reloads the configuration page from the system.

## Command Line Interface

The Wsprry Pi executable, wspr, is controlled by the Linux `systemd` controller. It will run in the background as soon as your Pi starts up. It is a singleton application by design, meaning only one `wspr` process may be running. You must stop the daemon if you desire to have some manual control for testing or other reasons. Here are some commands you may use:

- `sudo systemctl status wspr`: Show a status page for the running daemon.
- `sudo systemctl restart wspr`: Restart the daemon and wspr with it.
- `sudo systemctl stop wspr`: Stop the daemon. The daemon will restart again upon reboot.
- `sudo systemctl start wspr`: Start the daemon if it is not running.
- `sudo systemctl disable wspr`: Disable the daemon from restarting on reboot.
- `sudo systemctl enable wspr`: Enable the daemon to start on reboot if it is disabled.

You will control the shutdown button monitor daemon like `wspr`, substituting `shutdown-button` for `wspr` above.

To run wspr from the command line, a complete listing of command line options is available by executing `(sudo) /usr/local/bin/wspr -h`:

```text

Frequencies can be specified either as an absolute TX carrier frequency,
or using one of the following bands:

  LF, LF-15, MF, MF-15, 160m, 160m-15, 80m, 60m, 40m, 30m, 20m,
  17m, 15m, 12m, 10m, 6m, 4m, and 2m

If you specify a band, the transmission will happen in the middle of the
WSPR region of the selected band.

The "-15" suffix indicates the WSPR-15 region of the band.

You may create transmission gaps by specifying a TX frequency of 0.
```

### Command Line Entries for Testing

You may transmit a constant tone at a specific frequency for testing. In this example, wspr will send a tone at 780 kHz (780000 Hz):

`wspr --test-tone 780e3`

### Example Usage

Remember that anything that creates a transmission will require you to use `sudo`.

`wspr --help`

Display a brief help screen.

`wspr --test-tone 780e3`

Transmit a constant test tone at 780 kHz.

`wspr N9NNN EM10 33 20m`

Using callsign N9NNN, locator EM10, and TX power 33 dBm, transmit a single WSPR transmission on the 20m band using NTP-based frequency offset calibration.

`wspr --led N9NNN EM10 33 20m`

The same as above but using the red LED on transmit (TAPR Hat) to indicate an active transmission. The LED is connected to Pin 12 (GPIO18, BCM18).

`wspr --free-running N9NNN EM10 33 20m`

The same as above, but without NTP calibration.

`wspr --repeat --terminate 7 --ppm 43.17 N9NNN EM10 33 10140210 0 0 0 0`

Transmit a WSPR transmission slightly off-center on 30m every 10 minutes for seven transmissions, using a fixed PPM correction value.

`wspr --repeat --offset --self-calibration N9NNN EM10 33 40m`

Transmit repeatedly on 40m, use NTP-based frequency offset calibration, and add a random frequency offset to each transmission to minimize collisions with other transmitters.

## Transmission Timing

This software uses system time to determine the start of WSPR transmissions, so keep the system time synchronized within 1-second precision, i.e., use NTP network time synchronization or set the time manually with the `date` command. A WSPR broadcast starts on an even minute and takes 2 minutes for WSPR-2. Broadcasts will begin at minutes 0, 15, 30, and 45 and take 15 minutes for WSPR-15.

## Calibration

The system will use NTP calibration by default and produces a frequency error of about 0.1 PPM after the Pi has temperature stabilized and the NTP loop has converged.

Frequency calibration is required to ensure the WSPR-2 transmission occurs within the narrow 200 Hz band. The reference crystal on your RPi might have a frequency error (which, in addition, is temperature dependent -1.3Hz/deg C @10MHz). You may manually correct the frequency or add a PPM correction on the command line to calibrate the transmission.

## Power Level

You may specify the power level for exceptional cases where you desire an extremely low one. The options are:

- *Power Level**:
  - *0*: 2mA or -3.4dBm
  - *1*: 4mA or 2.1dBm
  - *2*: 6mA or 4.9dBm
  - *3*: 8mA or 6.6dBm
  - *4*: 10mA or 8.2dBm
  - *5*: 12mA or 9.2dBm
  - *6*: 14mA or 10.0dBm
  - *7*: 16mA or 10.6dBm (Default)

These levels are estimated at the Raspberry Pi GPIO according to Broadcom documentation. They do not consider any amplification, such as on the TAPR board.

### NTP Calibration

NTP automatically tracks and calculates a PPM frequency correction. If running NTP on your Pi, use the `--self-calibration` option to have this program query NTP for the latest frequency correction before each WSPR transmission. Some residual frequency errors may still be present due to delays in the NTP measurement loop, and this method works best if your Pi has been on for a long time, the crystal's temperature has stabilized, and the NTP control loop has converged.

### AM Calibration

A practical way to calibrate is to tune the transmitter on the same frequency as a medium wave AM broadcast station, keep tuning until zero-beat (the constant audio tone disappears when the transmitter is precisely on the same frequency as the broadcast station), and determine the frequency difference with the broadcast station. This difference is the frequency error that can be applied for correction while tuning on a WSPR frequency.

Suppose your local AM radio station is at 780kHz. Use the `--test-tone` option to produce different tones around 780kHz (e.g., 780100 Hz) until you can successfully zero-beat the AM station. If the zero-beat tone specified on the command line is F, calculate the PPM correction required as `ppm=(F/780000-1)*1e6`. In the future, specify this value as the argument to the `--ppm` option on the command line. You can verify that the ppm value has been set correction by specifying `--test-tone 780000 --ppm \<ppm\>` on the command line and confirming that the Pi is still zero beating the AM station.

## INI File

System daemon operations will read the `wspr.ini` file to supply execution parameters. During everyday use, there should be no reason to edit the file directly. The Wsprry Pi installer stores the file in the user data directory:

``` bash
$ ls -al /usr/local/etc
total 12
drwxr-xr-x  2 root root 4096 Feb 18 14:51 .
drwxr-xr-x 10 root root 4096 Sep 21 19:02 ..
-rw-rw-rw-  1 root root  171 Mar  6 19:47 wspr.ini
```

The INI file is a standard INI file with which you may already be familiar. It has three sections, Control, Common, and Extended. The application will ignore blank lines and other whitespaces. The settings are in a key/value pair separated by an equals sign. Comments are allowed and delineated by a semicolon.

The web page configuration will overwrite any comments added to the file.

Here is an example file:

``` ini
[Control]
Transmit = False ; Bool

[Common]
Call Sign = NXXX ; String of 7 or less
Grid Square = ZZ99 ; Four characters
TX Power = 20 ; Power in dBm is always a relatively low integer
Frequency = 20m ; This can be an integer with "m" on end, an integer as in "450000000", or an exponential format like "780e3"

[Extended]
PPM = 0.0 ; Double
Self Cal = True ; Bool
Offset = False; Bool
Use LED = False ; Bool
Power Level = 7 ; 0-7, 7 is max
```

- **Control**
   - *Transmit**: A true or false Boolean, indicating whether wspr will transmit. Even when not transmitting, wspr will continue to run and react to changes in the INI.
- **Common**
  - **Call Sign**: Your registered call sign.  Your callsign will be alphanumeric, contain no spaces, and be that which is assigned to you by your authorizing entity.
  - **Grid Square**: Your four-digit Maidenhead grid square. It will be two letters followed by two numbers.
  - **TX Power**:
  - **Frequency**: A string representing the frequency or a list of frequencies through which wspr will rotate. The notation can be an integer with "m" as a suffix indicating a standard band plan, an integer as in '450000000' representing the frequency in Hz, or an exponential format like '780e3'. The '-15' indicates it should use a 15-minute window in LF, MF, or 160m.
- **Extended**
  - **PPM*: A double for the PPM offset to use as a specific calibration. The compensation is not honored when in self-calibration mode.
  - **Self Cal**: A true/false Boolean indicating whether wspr should self-calibrate with the NTP clock.
  - **Offset**: = A true/false Boolean indicating whether to add a slight offset to each transmission.
  - **Use LED**: A true/false Boolean to use the LED attached to the TAPR board as a transmission indicator.
  - *Power Level**: A power level indicator, 0-7, the default is 7:
    - *0*: 2mA or -3.4dBm
    - *1*: 4mA or 2.1dBm
    - *2*: 6mA or 4.9dBm
    - *3*: 8mA or 6.6dBm
    - *4*: 10mA or 8.2dBm
    - *5*: 12mA or 9.2dBm
    - *6*: 14mA or 10.0dBm
    - *7*: 16mA or 10.6dBm


## PWM Peripheral

The code uses the RPi PWM peripheral to time the frequency transitions of the output clock. The RPi sound system also uses this peripheral; hence, any system sound events during a WSPR transmission will interfere with WSPR transmissions. Sound can be permanently disabled by editing `/etc/modules` and commenting out the `snd-bcm2835` device.

## RF And Electrical Considerations

The output of the Pi's PWM is a square wave, so a low-pass filter is REQUIRED. Knowing why this is required is part of learning to be a Ham. Connect a low-pass filter (via a decoupling capacitor) to GPIO4 (GPCLK0) and the Ground pin of your Raspberry Pi and connect an antenna to the LPF. The GPIO4 and GND pins are found on the main header on pins 7 and 9, respectively; the pin closest to the P1 label is pin 1, and its 3rd and 4th neighbor is pin 7 and 9, respectively. See [this link](http://elinux.org/RPi\_Low-level\_peripherals) for pin layout.

Examples of low-pass filters can be [found here](http://www.gqrp.com/harmonic\_filters.pdf) (PDF link). TAPR makes a [very nice shield for the Raspberry Pi](https://www.tapr.org/kits\_20M-wspr-pi.html) that is pre-assembled, performs the appropriate filtering for the selected band, and also amplifies the power output to 20dBm. Just connect your antenna, and you're good to go.

The expected power output is 10mW (+10dBm) in a 50 Ohm load without the TAPR hat. This power looks negligible, but when connected to a simple dipole antenna, this may result in reception reports ranging up to several thousand kilometers.

As the Raspberry Pi does not attenuate ripple and noise components from the 5V USB power supply, you should use a regulated supply with sufficient ripple suppression. You may see a supply ripple as mixing products centered around the transmit carrier, typically at 100/120Hz.

Do not expose GPIO4 to voltages or currents above the Absolute Maximum limits. GPIO4 outputs a digital clock in 3V3 logic, with a maximum current of 16mA. As no current protection is available and the system uses a DC component of 1.6V, do not short-circuit or place a resistive (dummy) load straight on the GPIO4 pin, as it may draw too much current. Instead, use a decoupling capacitor to remove the DC component when connecting the output dummy loads, transformers, antennas, etc. Do not expose GPIO4 to electrostatic voltages or voltages exceeding the 0 to 3.3V logic range; connecting an antenna directly to GPIO4 may damage your RPi due to transient voltages such as lightning or static buildup as well as RF from other transmitters operating into nearby antennas. Therefore, adding some form of isolation is recommended, e.g., using an RF transformer, a simple buffer/driver/PA stage, or two Schottky small signal diodes back-to-back.
