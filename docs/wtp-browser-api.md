# WsprryPi shared browser API adapter

The host adopts Pico API v1 resource names for their compatible meanings and
labels host projections `scope: wsprrypi-host/1`. It retains `/config`, `/api/wtp`,
`/api/wtp/recover` and existing controls. Browser URLs use the application proxy
prefix `/wsprrypi`; the table below shows backend paths.

| Resource | Implemented authority |
| --- | --- |
| GET `/api/v1/capabilities` | Host capabilities, observed WTP CAPS, supported ABORT, remote management availability and explicit limitations. |
| GET `/api/v1/status`, `/api/v1/jobs` | Copied observed remote `job`, `standalone: null`, transport `network`, and explicitly scoped `host` status. No new connection or recovery. |
| POST `/api/v1/jobs` or `/api/v1/jobs/<job-id>/abort` | Cancellation of that exact currently tracked host-owned/waiting job through the existing runtime. |
| GET/PUT `/api/v1/config` | Pico standalone station/Wi-Fi/schedule configuration, through serialized idle HTTPS. |
| GET/PUT `/api/v1/schedules` | Pico standalone schedule subresource, sharing Pico config revisions. |
| GET/PUT `/api/v1/network` | Pico network status/control, with its own remote revision. |
| GET/PUT `/api/v1/host/config` | Explicit `wsprrypi-host-config/1` application and transport settings. PUT applies a merge patch. |

The host does not redefine Pico `/config` as WsprryPi configuration. WsprryPi's
schedule remains owned by its existing application; remote standalone schedules
do not start a competing host worker. Browser raw CLAIM/LOAD/ARM, independent
ownership, SoftAP and BLE are unavailable. Capabilities report ABORT only and
`job_submission: host-application`; ordinary transmission uses the existing host
workflow. Management is temporarily unavailable during work or unresolved output,
not an independent connection around the scheduler.

## Cancellation, replay and precision

```json
{"session_id":"11111111111111111111111111111111","request_id":"22222222222222222222222222222222","operation":"ABORT","body":{"job_id":"33333333333333333333333333333333"}}
```

All three identities require 32 lowercase hexadecimal characters. Browser session
IDs scope request replay, not WTP ownership or authentication. The trusted host
operator delegates cancellation to the host runtime's real owner. The runtime
atomically checks the exact tracked job and ownership/waiting state before stop;
foreign jobs cannot be adopted or aborted. Browser cancellation never enables
transmission. A racing natural completion can win; successful `cleanup_ok` means
cleanup was confirmed, not that the terminal outcome was necessarily cancelled.

Identical canonical payloads with the same browser session/request return the
cached result. Changed payloads under that key return 409 `request_id_reuse`.
The process retains up to 1024 entries, reserves an unknown outcome before
invoking cancellation and fails closed at capacity instead of forgetting requests.
Replay history is process-local. After a restart, fresh WTP identities and
read-only inspection still cannot adopt old work. No automatic browser retry is
performed after an ambiguous result. Responses preserve the shared `ok`,
`request_id`, `result`/`error` envelope for cancellation; other failures use
`error.code`. WTP 64-bit counts, IDs/times/frequencies remain decimal strings.

## Revision and security policy

Host config GET provides a quoted SHA-256 ETag of its internal saved snapshot.
Host PUT requires exact If-Match: absent/empty is 428, stale is 412, and a
successful patch returns the resulting ETag. Legacy `/config` GET also supplies
ETag; its existing PATCH/PUT accept conditional writes, while legacy clients
without If-Match retain compatibility. The current UI autosave sends its loaded
revision. Conflict responses preserve the browser draft; load the saved settings
before retrying. Remote PUT passes through the Pico resource's exact If-Match and
ETag, without replacing its revision with a host-generated value. A lost remote
write result is unconfirmed; explicitly read saved state before retrying.

The existing trusted-LAN peer, Host, Origin and proxy-identity guard applies both
to direct backend requests and deployed proxy traffic. Shared mutations also
require Origin, `Content-Type: application/json`,
`X-WsprryPico-Request: 1`, and absent/same-origin/none Sec-Fetch-Site. No CORS grant
is added. Unknown shared routes, encoded/query aliases and duplicate authority/
intent headers are rejected. JSON is bounded to 32768 bytes, nesting to 32 and
object keys must be unique. The host route and API body guards are additional to
the existing server parser bounds. This remains the application's trusted-LAN
operator policy, not per-person login authentication; outbound mTLS authenticates
the configured host client credential.

Responses use no-store and nosniff. Copied status has no certificate/private-key
material. Host config exposes local credential references only. Remote config
retains Pico's password redaction; new passwords are submitted only by an explicit
save, kept out of browser storage and cleared after full-config success. A
schedule-only save keeps password and other unrelated drafts. Management never
runs periodically and never releases host ownership to poll the sole Pico TLS slot.
