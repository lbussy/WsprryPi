# VS Code Config

This folder is generally omitted by most developers.  However, I use [Code Spell Checker](https://cspell.org/) because my typing and spelling is horrendous and I need all the help I can get.  There is an "add to workspace" configuration for things like variable/function/method names you add, to keep them from showing up as typos.  These igored words stored in `/vscode/settings.json`.

I don't think this will mess anyone up - we wil see.
