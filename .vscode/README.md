# VS Code Config

This folder is generally omitted by most developers.  I have included it for:

- `settings.json`: For the purposes of a spell checker, some words are unique to the project.
- `c_cpp_properties.json`: This helps Intellisense undertsand the environment.
- `extensions.json`: Prompts to install the extensions I use if they are not already installed.

I don't think this will mess anyone up - we will see.
