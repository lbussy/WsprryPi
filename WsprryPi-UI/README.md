# Wsprry Pi UI

This is the Bootstrap UI for [Wsprry Pi](https://github.com/WsprryPi/WsprryPi/).
It is installed with the current application installation.

## Packaged UI manifest

`scripts/generate_ui_manifest.py` generates and validates the schema-v1,
content-addressed manifest used to identify a packaged UI artifact. Generation
is build-time infrastructure. The normal installer copies the exact UI source
into a sibling staging directory, generates and validates the manifest there,
confirms that the staged installed and packaged identities match, and only then
publishes the complete directory tree. Failed staging or validation does not
replace the live UI.

The identity covers every regular file below the selected UI root except the
top-level runtime `cache/` and `backups/` directories, `ui-manifest.json`
itself, and `.DS_Store` metadata. Symbolic links and unsafe or non-normalized
manifest paths are rejected. Each record contains a normalized relative path
and a SHA-256 content digest; timestamps, permissions, ownership, and traversal
order are not identity inputs.

Generate and then validate a manifest with:

```sh
python3 scripts/generate_ui_manifest.py \
  --ui-root data \
  --output /tmp/ui-manifest.json \
  --source-commit "$(git rev-parse HEAD)" \
  --application-version 0.0.0
python3 scripts/generate_ui_manifest.py --validate /tmp/ui-manifest.json
```

Run the focused regression suite with `npm run test:manifest`.

The same module provides the read-only `classify_installed_ui()` comparison
layer. It validates the immutable packaged manifest, calculates the identity
of the covered files currently present, and returns `packaged`,
`locally_modified`, or fail-closed `unknown` state with deterministic modified,
added, and missing path lists. Classification does not alter installed files.

## Installed UI identity

The UI-owned `/wsprrypi/ui-version.php` endpoint compares the installed UI to
the immutable manifest and reports its installed and packaged identities,
classification state, and modified, added, and missing path lists. The
`/wsprrypi/ui-manifest.php` endpoint exposes the validated packaged manifest.
Both responses disable caching.

Every rendered page embeds the installed identity and uses it as the cache key
for UI assets. These endpoints are ordinary Apache/PHP UI resources; they are
not proxied to the running service. `/wsprrypi/version` remains the service
version endpoint.

An open page polls the UI-owned identity endpoint. A changed installed identity
prompts once for a refresh and supplies that identity as the refresh cache key.
A page that loads with the requested identity has converged; a mismatch instead
shows a persistent consistency diagnostic and suppresses further prompts. A
stable packaged or locally modified installation does not prompt, and service
or executable version changes do not participate in UI refresh decisions.

The published manifest is read-only and owned outside the Apache/PHP runtime
account. Top-level `cache/` and `backups/` content remains excluded from the
identity and may be runtime-owned without changing the packaged classification.

Before replacing a locally modified installation, the publisher creates a
unique verified backup below `/var/backups/wsprrypi/ui`. It preserves modified
and added files plus the prior manifest, and records missing files in
`modification-report.json`. If prior state is unknown, it backs up the complete
covered UI tree. Backup failure prevents replacement; customizations are never
merged automatically. `--fail-on-ui-modifications` makes the installer refuse
replacement instead. The installer relists the affected files, backup and
report locations, and actual replacement status as its final output block.
